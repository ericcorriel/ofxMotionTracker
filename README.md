This example project files for this version run against OF 007.

This version doesn't include `ofCircleSlice`
(http://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1811) since it
requires patching ofGraphics.

I believe the original author is Pat Long, and I think
http://code.google.com/p/peoplevision/ shows up somewhere in the lineage of
this lib.

dependencies:
  ofxOpenCV
  ofxXmlSettings
  ofxTI_Util (https://github.com/jamezilla/ofxTI_Util)
